    Hi, I'm Lemon. I have been making video games for over 2 years.

    Two years ago, I released my first game, Astro Blaster. It was made in about a week and currently has 34 downloads.

<h1 class="title">
    One year later, I decided to make a sequel, Solar. It was basically a more polished version of Astro Blaster, with some quality-of-life improvements.
